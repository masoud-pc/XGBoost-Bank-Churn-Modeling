# XGBoost-Bank-Churn-Modeling


“In 2012, 50% of customers, globally, either changed their banks or were planning to change. In the US and Canada, customers who changed their banks increased from 38% in 2011 to 45% in 2012.” – Global Consumer Banking, Survey 2012, Ernst & Young

This project deals with a well-known problem called "the churn modeling". Customer churn and engagement has become one of the top issues for most banks. It is vital to maintain current customers to prevent capital outflow.

In this project, a classifier model is trained using XGBoost library. The dataset containing information of Bank clients is available. The model is implemented in both Python and R.
